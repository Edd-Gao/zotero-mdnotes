Go to `Tools > Mdnotes preferences`

{% include figure image_path="/images/mdnotes-export-preferences.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Export preferences" %}

## File naming convention

In general, I recommend using the `citekey` as title. The exported files will use the prefix and suffix for the type of file being exported, following the pattern `<prefix><title><suffix>.md`.

{% include figure image_path="/images/mdnotes-export-preferences-2.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Settings for the file naming convention" %}

## Add the created files as linked files to Zotero

If you select the "Attach file links to Zotero", the markdown files will be two clicks away from inside Zotero:

{% include figure image_path="/images/attach-link-to-zotero.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" %}
