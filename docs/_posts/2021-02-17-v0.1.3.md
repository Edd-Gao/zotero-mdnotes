excerpt: Different menus for single- and multi-file exports
---

## Changelog

- Make the Mdnotes menu slightly context-aware. If you select the single-file option under `File organization`, the menu should now be somewhat less confusing. This release also includes better documentation on how to use the single-file config option.
- The `Create Standalone Note` menu is now optional and can be deactivated in the preferences.
